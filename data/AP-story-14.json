["BETHESDA, Md.", "(AP) \u2014 Researchers hooked Zach Ault to medical monitors as he slowly climbed onto a gym bike.", "An invisible disease is sidelining this once avid athlete and he knew the simple exercise would wipe him out -- but Ault was pedaling for science.", "Chronic fatigue syndrome is one of medicine\u2019s most vexing mysteries.", "Now doctors at the National Institutes of Health are using volunteers like Ault for a unique study that pushes their limits in search of what\u2019s stealing all their energy.", "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to exercise my way out of this multiple times and I\u2019ve put myself in deeper pits every time,\u201d said Ault, 36, of Paducah, Kentucky, as he began a nearly two-week stint at the research-only hospital outside the nation\u2019s capital.", "\u201cChronic fatigue is kind of like they took the stopper out of the energy reserve tank,\u201d and no amount of sleep replenishes it, he said.", "Up to 2.5 million Americans are estimated to have what is known officially as ME/CFS -- it stands for \u201cmyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.\u201d Its hallmark is profound fatigue, lasting more than six months, that\u2019s made even worse by any type of exertion.", "Among other symptoms, patients also tend to have difficulty staying upright or cognitive trouble often described as a \u201cbrain fog.\u201d Many go undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or dismissed by skeptical doctors.", "Decades after it was first recognized, scientists don\u2019t know what causes it.", "There are no approved treatments, or even tests to help diagnosis -- and no way to predict who will recover and who will have a severe case that leaves them debilitated, even bed-bound, for years.", "\u201cThe ignorance about the condition just vastly dwarfs what we know about it,\u201d said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of NIH\u2019s National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which is leading the research.", "The NIH has more than doubled funding -- to more than $14 million -- for scientists around the country to unravel the biology of ME/CFS since 2015, when the influential Institute of Medicine decried \u201ca paucity of research.\u201d  Part of the trouble is that varied symptoms make it hard to compare patients.", "A patient advocacy group called Solve ME/CFS Initiative is preparing to open a registry where patients can send in medical information and blood and saliva samples to help scientists expand research.", "And illustrating the desperation for answers, nearly 500 patients have called seeking to enroll in NIH\u2019s own study that is putting a few dozen under the microscope, with a barrage of sophisticated tests few hospitals can offer under one roof.", "Like many such patients, Ault\u2019s disease struck following a run-of-the-mill infection in 2017.", "He\u2019d been training for a half-marathon but after a little time off to recover, he tried to resume his runs and couldn\u2019t.", "His diagnosis came after months of tests for other explanations.", "\u201cHis body had literally hijacked him and it wasn\u2019t going to allow him to push through,\u201d said Anne Ault, his wife.", "Ault, a father of three, was missing his kids\u2019 sporting and school activities, even his nightly wrestle with his young son.", "He had to cut back his job, in the ministry, to half-days.", "When 16 hours of sleep a day made no difference, his wife, a pharmacist, hunted research opportunities.", "Ault fit the bill for the NIH study, which is focusing on people who came down with the disease after an infection, of any sort, within five years.", "That initial infection is long gone but maybe, the body\u2019s normal reactions to illness went into a destructive tailspin.", "\u201cYou\u2019re really capturing the disease at a specific point in time,\u201d in its crucial early stages, said Sadie Whittaker, scientific director for the Solve ME/CFS Initiative.", "\u201cNo one has studied such a very specific population to such depth before.\u201d There are some clues.", "Earlier studies have found brain inflammation in patients, and nervous system abnormalities that might explain why they feel worse upright than lying down.", "The immune system seems to be on chronic alert.", "Then there\u2019s the energy drain.", "Just last month, Cornell University researchers reported that patients\u2019 key immune cells don\u2019t make energy properly.", "The NIH study is looking for more clues.", "It starts with a week-plus hospitalization for blood and genetic tests, brain scans, a spinal tap, sleep tests, a check of gut bacteria.", "Scientists pore over the results before deciding who to invite back for a longer and more rigorous visit.", "\u201cGo as far as you can, work as hard as you can,\u201d NIH physical therapist Bart Drinkard told Ault as he climbed onto the exercise bike.", "Cells, in particular little factories inside cells called mitochondria, use oxygen and nutrients to create energy.", "While Ault pedals, scientists can measure how his leg muscles use oxygen, and see if that\u2019s different than in a healthy person.", "Afterward, doctors fit a special cap on Ault to track electrical activity in his brain, and then sent him to spend the night in an air-tight chamber.", "Pipes draw out the room\u2019s air for analysis.", "How much oxygen is used and carbon dioxide is produced tells how much energy Ault is using, minute by minute.", "\u201cWe can calculate every molecule.", "It\u2019s the cleanest air we have in the hospital,\u201d said NIH\u2019s Kong Chen, a metabolism specialist.", "\u201cWe\u2019re figuring out how his body adjusts to an exercise load, or a stress load.\u201d Researchers are clear: The study doesn\u2019t offer any treatments, although the hope is to find targets to eventually develop some.", "But Ault says it did help to learn about the disease and tricks to conserve his energy and pace himself \u201cso I can try to stay as healthy as possible without such bad consequences.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard not knowing if I\u2019m going to recover, if or when,\u201d he said."]
