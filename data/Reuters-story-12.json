["3 Min Read SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Coastal nations around the Singapore Strait must step up surveillance and patrols of the strategic waterway after a sharp rise in piracy incidents last year, maritime watchdog ReCAAP said on Wednesday.", "The number of piracy and armed robbery incidents in the Strait jumped to 31 in 2019, up from seven in 2018 and the highest since 99 in 2015, the group said in a report.", "The incidents occurred amid a slight uptick in sea robberies across Asia with 82 total incidents, still the second-lowest since 2007.", "They were mainly minor cases of scrap metal theft although some did involve knives, machetes and, in one instance, a gun, the group said.", "\u201cWe would like to ask the littoral states - Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia - to enhance the surveillance and control in the Singapore Strait because of this rapid increase of incidents,\u201d ReCAAP executive director Masafumi Kuroki said.", "ReCAAP has received a number of enquiries from shipping firms expressing concern about the increase, Kuroki said.", "Military leaders from Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand will hold talks this week in the city-state to discuss the increase of sea robberies in the Strait and possible measures to disrupt such incidents, Singapore\u2019s defense ministry said on Wednesday.", "Singapore\u2019s Maritime Port Authority said it takes a \u201cserious view\u201d of the recent armed robbery incidents and has been broadcasting alerts to vessels to exercise vigilance when traveling along the Strait.", "Analysts are divided over whether the rise in incidents pose any threat to Singapore\u2019s vital maritime industry.", "\u201cThe attacks have occurred against a variety of ships and cargoes suggesting that they are opportunistic rather than targeted,\u201d said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the United Nations and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council.", "\u201cCaution will be heightened and additional measures may be taken, but for geographic, economic and practical reasons, Singapore\u2019s stature in maritime commerce will not be damaged.\u201d\u00a0  But Bilveer Singh, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore\u2019s department of political science, called the rise \u201csimply unbelievable\u201d and said it comes at a bad time for Singapore\u2019s maritime trade which is already suffering from the U.S.-China trade war and a global economic slowdown.", "For now, there has been a limited impact on the industry.", "\u201cThe cost to the shipping industry of these claims is fairly low,\u201d said Jack Marriott-Smalley, regional underwriting director at Charles Taylor Mutual Management, an insurance services provider."]
