["22 Min Read LEBANON, Ohio (Reuters) - Something wasn\u2019t right with the Rhino.", "Reports started trickling in to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 2005 of people being killed or injured in the Yamaha Motor Co off-road vehicles when they tipped over.", "But no clear pattern emerged, and in the rough and tumble off-road world, accidents are common.", "The agency took no action.", "Then, in 2007, ten-year-old Ellie Sand was killed in a Rhino when it flipped in a cornfield in Warren County, Ohio.", "Her father, house painter John Sand, started reading up on other Rhino crashes.", "He spoke to other parents whose children had died or been seriously injured in similar incidents.", "He became convinced that Rhinos were the problem.", "Using a computer in a Cincinnati law library, Sand found more than a dozen lawsuits alleging that the vehicles were dangerously unstable.", "Some of the lawsuits \u2013 like the one he filed against the company in 2008 \u2013 claimed that design flaws caused the Rhinos to roll over even at slow speeds on flat ground.", "Sand sent the results of his research to CPSC, highlighting details from the lawsuits of the tip-overs that led to deaths and injuries.", "Soon after, CPSC sent a subpoena to Yamaha, forcing it to hand over a trove of information, much of which had lain hidden under judges\u2019 protective orders in the lawsuits against the company.", "By then, more than 40 people, including more than a dozen children, had been killed in Rhino crashes.", "The impact of Sand\u2019s work was confirmed in a voicemail message Sand received a few months later.", "Yamaha had agreed to a voluntary recall covering more than 100,000 Rhinos to fix the stability problems.", "\u201cAs a result of the information \u2013 a lot of the information that we received from you \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten this far, so I wanted to thank you,\u201d Marc Schoem, then deputy director of CPSC\u2019s compliance and field operations, said in the March 31, 2009, message, which was reviewed by Reuters.", "Five years after the recall was announced, CPSC staff noted in a 2014 briefing that crashes involving the Rhino had \u201cdecreased noticeably.\u201d  Sand told Reuters he \u201cwas elated that the work I\u2019d done could help stop the carnage.\u201d Still, he was surprised that it took an \u201caverage Joe\u201d like him to flag the lawsuits to CPSC.", "A CPSC spokesman said that the agency had investigated Rhino incidents and that establishing a pattern that would have supported finding the vehicles defective proved challenging.", "Schoem declined to comment, as did Yamaha.", "CPSC is one of more than a dozen regulatory agencies tasked with protecting Americans from dangerous products.", "And the Rhino episode reveals a troubling dynamic in the way these watchdogs do their jobs: Sometimes the only way they can learn about and act on a possible threat to consumers is from evidence produced in lawsuits, but that evidence is often hidden behind a wall of secrecy.", "Most regulators have their own reporting systems for conducting oversight.", "But their databases can be vast and unwieldy, stuffed with thousands and even millions of consumer complaints and reports from manufacturers of safety concerns, injuries or deaths.", "The reports are often rife with mistakes and inconsistencies.", "Not all consumers even know they can file complaints.", "And companies regularly flout legally mandated reporting requirements.", "That leaves the courts as a conduit for alerting regulators to potential harm, and it\u2019s far from perfect.", "As Reuters has documented in earlier articles in this series, a thick blanket of secrecy covers product-liability litigation in the United States.", "In just a handful of cases over the past several decades, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or injured by defective products \u2013 cars, drugs, guns \u2013 while information about the risks was hidden from consumers and regulators, sometimes for years, behind broad protective orders.", "These orders, though meant to protect specific information such as medical records and trade secrets, often give companies wide latitude to designate as confidential material exchanged between litigants in the pretrial discovery process \u2013 internal emails, data, research, meeting minutes, sworn depositions and the like.", "The secrecy typically persists for the life of the case, and long after, though court documents are, by law, presumed to be public.", "In an analysis of some of the largest mass defective-product cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years, Reuters found 55 in which judges sealed information concerning public health and safety.", "And among those, only three had protective orders containing language specifically allowing information exchanged by the litigants to be shared with regulators.", "Regulators may subpoena information from a manufacturer after spotting a suspicious cluster of lawsuits, or after being alerted by a consumer like Sand in the Yamaha Rhino case.", "But those are rare exceptions.", "And regulators themselves aren\u2019t inclined to mine court records as a means of oversight.", "In the 55 big cases Reuters reviewed, public court filings contained no indication that regulators had requested any information arising from the lawsuits.", "A few years ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and CPSC issued pleas for easier access to evidence introduced in court under protective orders.", "But the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 15 other federal departments or agencies surveyed by Reuters did not point to any explicit policy or guidance on gaining access to court evidence potentially relevant to their oversight functions.", "Yet regulators have repeatedly documented the failures of existing safeguards.", "Since 2009, NHTSA and CPSC have fined a total of at least 90 companies for failing to meet safety-reporting requirements, while the FDA has issued more than a dozen warning letters to manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for similar lapses.", "Big business and its lobbyists contend that regulators have all the tools they need to do their jobs well \u2013 including the power to subpoena information subject to a judge\u2019s protective order.", "\u201cThe protective order cannot block the government,\u201d said Victor Schwartz, a partner at law firm Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon LLP who has defended companies in civil litigation.", "\u201cLitigation gets publicity.", "If the government sees something about a case \u2026 it can use its power, the subpoena power, to find out more detail,\u201d he said.", "That argument, former U.S. regulatory officials said, doesn\u2019t hold water when litigation is cloaked in secrecy.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22,\u201d said David Friedman, a former NHTSA official.", "If documents and other evidence in litigation are sealed, \u201chow are you supposed to know about them?\u201d Friedman said.", "\u201cIf you don\u2019t know about them, you can\u2019t get them.\u201d  Friedman was at NHTSA during General Motors Co\u2019s notorious 2014 recall of millions of cars with defective ignition switches, ultimately linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries.", "A 2015 deferred prosecution agreement between GM and federal prosecutors showed the company scrambled for years to make sense of mounting reports of deaths and injuries while keeping regulators and the public in the dark about the switches, even after uncovering clear internal evidence they were defective.", "As early as 2003, NHTSA received complaints that Saturn Ions were stalling and, by 2004, that their airbags were failing to deploy in collisions.", "Similar complaints soon cropped up about Chevrolet Cobalts.", "In the ensuing years, the agency examined several fatal Cobalt crashes, each involving switches that slipped out of position and disabled airbags.", "Yet NHTSA didn\u2019t make the connection between the switch problem and airbag failures.", "That was partly because its investigators misunderstood how GM\u2019s airbag system operated, but also because NHTSA rules gave automakers a lot of leeway in how they reported certain information regarding safety risks.", "As a result, similar incidents were reported inconsistently.", "One was listed as an \u201cengine and engine cooling\u201d issue, for instance, while another as an \u201celectrical\u201d problem.", "That made it difficult for regulators to detect a pattern.", "From the first consumer complaints and incident reports, it would be more than 10 years and scores of deaths and injuries before NHTSA and the public learned of the link between defective ignition switches and airbag failures \u2013 and then only after evidence of what GM knew emerged in litigation and prompted the automaker to pursue a recall.", "In June 2011, the parents of Jennifer Brooke Melton filed a product-liability lawsuit against the company in a Georgia state court.", "Melton, a 29-year-old nurse, was killed in March 2010 when her Cobalt stalled on a rainy highway, crossed into oncoming traffic, collided with another vehicle and careened into a creek.", "The Melton case started, as many like it do, under a veil of secrecy.", "In December 2011, Judge Kathryn Tanksley approved a broad protective order, keeping from the public and NHTSA any documents that GM designated \u201cin good faith\u201d as confidential.", "Tanksley, now retired, said she approved the order because both the Meltons\u2019 lawyer and GM agreed to the terms.", "\u201cThe role of litigation is not to regulate GM,\u201d she said.", "When NHTSA officials want more information, she said, they \u201chave to pursue it not through the court, but through their own power.\u201d  The documents GM began turning over to Lance Cooper, the Meltons\u2019 lawyer, were damning.", "They showed that in 2005, for example, a company engineer suggested a fix for less than $1 per vehicle, but it was rejected as too costly and not effective enough.", "Cooper also obtained evidence that the company modified the switches between 2005 and 2008 to keep them from slipping.", "The evidence built a strong case that GM had known for years that the switches were faulty.", "The Meltons were eager to go public with the evidence to prevent others from dying as their daughter had, but Cooper worried that if he challenged the protective order and regulators didn\u2019t conclude the switches were defective, it would hurt their case.", "GM wanted to settle.", "\u201cWe thought that people needed to know.", "There were still people out there driving those cars,\u201d Beth Melton told Reuters.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that these things are kept secret and other people (suffer) because of it.\u201d  Meanwhile, a Cobalt crash in Quebec, Canada, killed another driver.", "The airbags did not deploy.", "The ignition switch was later found to be in accessory mode, the position between on and off that could cut power to airbags.", "GM settled with the Meltons in September 2013 for $5 million.", "Five months later, after conducting its own investigation, GM recalled about 600,000 vehicles with the ignition switch.", "Cooper still wasn\u2019t satisfied, based on what he had learned in the Melton lawsuit, and having obtained a settlement for his clients, he decided it was time to share evidence with NHTSA.", "\u201cI basically said: \u2018The hell with it,\u2019 \u201c Cooper said.", "\u201cIf we can get this information to the federal government, they need it.", "Really, it was just a strategic decision to violate the protective order.\u201d  In a letter to NHTSA , he suggested that the automaker knew about the defect far longer than its recall paperwork said and had not recalled enough vehicles.", "He urged the agency to investigate, citing evidence from the Melton case that he had seen as much as a year earlier.", "Eventually, NHTSA, Congress and federal prosecutors all investigated, relying heavily on evidence from the Melton case.", "GM increased the size of the recall, which eventually covered 2.6 million vehicles.", "In May 2014, NHTSA fined GM $35 million for failing to alert regulators to the defective ignition switch in a timely manner.", "The next year, GM entered into the deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York to settle criminal charges of concealing information from government officials and wire fraud.", "Under the deal, GM agreed to pay a $900 million fine and to submit to three years of oversight by an independent monitor.", "In 2018, a federal judge dismissed the charges against the company after prosecutors said the company had complied with the agreement.", "\u201cThe most damning information came out in litigation,\u201d said Kevin Vincent, NHTSA\u2019s head lawyer at the time.", "Though the facts eventually came to light, Vincent said, initial confidentiality in the Melton case \u201cstymied\u201d the agency.", "\u201cThat was evidence the agency needed to see,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe could have acted sooner.\u201d  In a statement to Reuters, GM said: \u201cSince 2014, we have undertaken comprehensive reforms across the company to ensure that something like the ignition switch crisis never happens again.\u201d The company hired additional safety investigators, created a new executive position charged with overseeing global safety and recalls, and launched a program aimed at giving employees and dealers easier ways to flag potential vehicle defects.", "A NHTSA spokesman said the agency took 17 steps the U.S. Transportation Department inspector general recommended in the wake of the ignition-switch recall to improve collection and analysis of vehicle safety data.", "In 2016, NHTSA and CPSC, seeking to address what they acknowledge is a blind spot in their efforts to safeguard consumers, issued bulletins recommending that judges and litigants agree to protective orders that would allow them to share confidential evidence pertinent to public health and safety with the relevant regulators.", "\u201cOur job is to protect consumers,\u201d said Marietta Robinson, a CPSC commissioner at the time.", "\u201cObtaining information about an allegedly dangerous product from a lawyer representing a consumer who has been injured or killed is critically important to us doing that job.\u201d  NHTSA\u2019s bulletin, which cited the GM ignition-switch case, argued that keeping such information hidden from regulators clashes with federal legal requirements for courts to show \u201cgood cause\u201d before allowing companies to keep it secret.", "But the bulletins, published in the Federal Register, where the government publishes new rules, proposals and public notices, carried no enforcement power, and they have had little impact.", "Judges have rarely shown willingness to grant requests from plaintiffs, expert witnesses or news organizations to share information with regulators or the public.", "Lawyers challenged defendants\u2019 claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 26 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed, and in most of them, judges refused to unseal the evidence.", "Some of those cases involved attempts to share information with the FDA.", "The FDA declined to comment on specific cases for this article.", "In general, the agency said, its powers to inspect drug makers\u2019 plants and launch criminal investigations, along with voluntary reporting requirements for drug makers, \u201cprovide FDA with the tools to keep patients and consumers safe and fulfill its mission to protect and promote the public health.\u201d  However, in the case of Pfizer Inc\u2019s popular drug Chantix, which helps people quit smoking, court secrecy excluded possibly pertinent information from the agency\u2019s process for assessing safety.", "The FDA approved Chantix in 2006.", "Three years later, it placed a black box warning \u2013 its strongest \u2013 on the drug\u2019s label after receiving \u201creports of changes in behavior such as hostility, agitation, depressed mood, and suicidal thoughts or actions.\u201d  Over time, Pfizer faced thousands of lawsuits blaming Chantix for such side effects.", "The company turned over millions of documents to plaintiffs under the condition they be kept confidential.", "In 2014, after Pfizer settled most of the cases for about $300 million, two plaintiff experts decided the FDA and the public should see internal Pfizer documents and expert reports that had been introduced in litigation.", "Through their lawyer, clinical psychiatrist Joseph Glenmullen and drug safety researcher Thomas Moore asked the judge overseeing the bulk of the Chantix litigation to unseal the information, which they said was important for \u201cshedding light on Pfizer\u2019s awareness of Chantix\u2019s behavioral risks.\u201d  Two days after their request was filed, U.S. District Judge Inge Johnson in Alabama rejected it.", "Her brief order did not address the substance of the request.", "Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.", "The upshot was that, two years later, an FDA advisory panel did not have access to all the information the two men had sought to make public as it considered a Pfizer request to remove the black box warning.", "Pfizer\u2019s request was based on its own study claiming that Chantix did not have a significant association with depression and suicide.", "The advisory panel of medical experts in September 2016 recommended in a close vote to remove the black box warning.", "The FDA removed the black box warning a few months later.", "Chantix bottles still carry a less severe warning of potential mental health side effects.", "Moore acknowledged that it\u2019s impossible to know whether the evidence he and Glenmullen sought to provide to regulators would have changed the panel\u2019s decision.", "But he said he remains frustrated that information \u201ccentral\u201d to the question of Chantix\u2019s safety never made it into regulators\u2019 hands.", "\u201cThe FDA should be able to see it,\u201d Moore said.", "Pfizer, in a statement to Reuters, said: \u201cThe FDA and its 2016 advisory panel had access to all of the data and science on Chantix, and all of the adverse events reports.\u201d The plaintiff experts\u2019 reports, the company noted, were not original science and instead reflected views of the underlying science that differed from the FDA and the advisory panel\u2019s conclusions.", "Members of the FDA advisory panel Reuters contacted said they were unaware of Moore and Glenmullen\u2019s efforts.", "One of them was Dr Jess Fiedorowicz, director of the University of Iowa Mood Disorders Center.", "He voted to remove the black box warning.", "He said he didn\u2019t know whether the evidence from the two experts would have changed his mind, but, \u201cI\u2019m all for transparency in research.\u201d  In September, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act to address the problem of court secrecy.", "The bill would allow parties in litigation to share evidence related to public health and safety with state and federal regulators, regardless of protective orders.", "Nadler\u2019s pledge came during a hearing on courtroom transparency that was called after Reuters began publishing its series on court secrecy and its impact on public health and safety.", "Previous iterations of the bill introduced repeatedly since the early 1990s, despite enjoying bipartisan support, have ultimately failed in the face of sustained opposition from business groups that contend it would increase the costs and burdens of litigation for companies that are already meeting regulatory reporting requirements.", "However, as the Yamaha Rhino episode and others like it show, regulators and the public can\u2019t assume manufacturers are meeting disclosure and reporting rules.", "A few months after John Sand sent a packet stuffed with his research to CPSC, the agency told Yamaha it had received information indicating that the Rhino could roll over at low speeds on flat ground, posing \u201can unreasonable risk of injury or death to riders.\u201d It told the company to send it all relevant information, including documents from Rhino-related litigation.", "CPSC spent the next few months trying to get Yamaha to comply, at one point complaining to the company that it was sending \u201cduplicative\u201d material and that \u201cthe only new item seems to be a Model Year 2009 owner\u2019s manual for the Rhino.\u201d  Only after CPSC subpoenaed Yamaha did the company send to the agency a 70-page written response, a hard drive and 62 DVDs that contained all of the records the company had produced in years of litigation, including company documents that had been subject to protective orders.", "CPSC would have known about the Rhino much earlier if Yamaha hadn\u2019t repeatedly violated the rules for notifying the agency of a possible defect, according to William Kitzes, a former adviser to the agency and an expert witness for plaintiffs in Rhino litigation who reviewed correspondence between the regulator and Yamaha.", "Companies must report to the agency immediately upon learning that a product is defective or can cause injury or death, or when a product is subject to three or more personal-injury lawsuits in a two-year period that are settled or decided in favor of plaintiffs.", "From 2004 to late 2008, Yamaha faced about 250 lawsuits alleging that Rhinos were unsafe.", "\u201cCertainly no later than, and by many measures well before the end of 2005 ... Yamaha had adequate information to report,\u201d Kitzes wrote in a report for plaintiffs.", "CPSC didn\u2019t fine Yamaha for failure to report Rhino incidents.", "The agency and Yamaha jointly announced the Rhino recall on March 31, 2009 \u2013 referred to at the time, on Yamaha\u2019s insistence, as a \u201cfree repair program.\u201d  In 2011, the Ohio jury hearing Sand\u2019s case found the Rhino defective, but awarded Sand no damages.", "Ellie was not wearing a helmet when she was killed, and the jury determined that she, her parents and others were negligent in her death.", "Yamaha stopped making the vehicles in 2013.", "Additional reporting by Erica Evans and Dan Levine.", "Edited by Janet Roberts and John Blanton."]
