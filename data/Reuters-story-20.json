["5 Min Read SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three years ago, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, then Treasurer, brandished a lump of coal in parliament as a totem of how the ruling conservative coalition planned to keep the lights on and power prices low.", "Now, with the country experiencing one of its worst ever bushfire seasons and facing criticism for his pro-coal policies, Morrison is acknowledging climate change is real.", "He is also talking about \u201cadaptation\u201d and \u201cresilience\u201d.", "\u201cI think we want to have a high level of confidence that as a nation we are improving our resilience and our adaptation to respond to the reality of the environment in which we live,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.", "Australia\u2019s Science Minister Karen Andrews told the Sydney Morning Herald in an interview that climate denial was a waste of time, as she echoed Morrison\u2019s \u201cadaptation\u201d mantra.", "As bushfires tore through New South Wales state in December, Morrison avoided drawing a link between the unusually early and ferocious fire season and climate change, saying the time was not right for such discussions.", "Just last week he said Sydney radio 2GB it was disappointing that people were conflating the bushfire crisis with Australia\u2019s emission reduction targets.", "While the softening of his stance is significant, scepticism remains over whether it will translate to a stronger climate policy as large swathes of the country continue to burn.", "\u201cIt\u2019s much overdue for the government to seriously engage on climate change adaptation,\u201d said Frank Jotzo, a professor at the Australian National University\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy.", "\u201cBut what also needs to happen is for the Australian government to take a proactive stance on climate mitigation, that is, to reduce green house emissions.", "And there is still no clear signs that\u2019s about to happen.\u201d  Blazes burning since September have claimed the lives of 28 people, killed more than a billion animals and ripped through forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria.", "The hazy skies in Australia\u2019s major cities have become a common occurrence, denting the country\u2019s clean and green image, hurting tourism and consumer sentiment.", "The mood in the country is also changing.", "A poll from the Australia Institute on Wednesday showed the country\u2019s bushfire crisis has intensified concerns about climate change with almost seven in 10 Australians wanting the government to lead on climate action.", "Morrison, whose popularity has sunk to its lowest levels since he took over leadership in 2018 over the government\u2019s bushfire response, continues to espouse the merits of coal.", "\u201cOur resources industry is incredibly important to Australia,\u201d he reiterated on Wednesday, adding coal \u201cis worth A$70 billion ($48.3 billion) to Australia and it is important to communities across the country.\u201d  Mining jobs account for just under 2% of all employment in the country, miniscule in comparison with construction, retail, healthcare and tourism-related sectors.", "Morrison repeated his government will \u201cmeet and beat\u201d a 26% global emissions reduction target agreed in Paris, \u201cwithout putting taxes on people, putting up electricity prices and pulling out the rugs from regional communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods.\u201d  Academics and climate scientists say 26% is a lowball reductions target especially if as planned Australia uses its old carbon credits from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol - another sore point for activists.", "Australia\u2019s reliance on coal-fired power makes it one of the world\u2019s largest carbon emitters per capita and last year it approved a huge new coal mine by India\u2019s Adani Enterprises.", "U.S. climatologist and geophysicist Michael Mann told Reuters that Morrison\u2019s position was \u201cridiculous\u201d.", "\u201cIf we continue to warm the planet, then we will in all likelihood exceed our adaptive capacity,\u201d he said in an email.", "\u201cIn other words, there is no amount of adaptation that will allow Australians to contend with the impacts of climate change if we allow for a further escalation of the problem.\u201d  In fact, Mann said, Australia could become so hot and dry that its residents could join the ranks of the world\u2019s \u201cclimate refugees.\u201d   ($1 = 1.4503 Australian dollars)  Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Lincoln Feast."]
